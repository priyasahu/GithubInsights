This project is to get the github insights - 

Here I used Oktokit which can connect to github , either by providing our credentials or by our private access key.
I used two ways to get the response from the api that is 
  1. Net http
  2. Rest Client
Getting the list of the project for the author with Net http
Getting the number of commits added by the user. 
Simillary we can find other details from the api.
